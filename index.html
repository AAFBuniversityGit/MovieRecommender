            <h1>Movie Recommender</h1>
            <p>The Movie Recommender project uses ML.NET to build a recommendation system that predicts the rating a
                user is likely to give to a particular movie. Based on this rating, the system recommends movies that
                are likely to match the user's preferences.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The model is built using a collaborative filtering approach known as Matrix Factorization. It works by
                analyzing the interactions between users and movies to predict how a specific user might rate a movie
                they haven't seen yet. The model is trained on a dataset containing user-movie ratings, and it learns
                patterns that allow it to make accurate predictions for unseen data.</p>
            <p>Once trained, the model can predict ratings for new user-movie pairs. If the predicted rating is above a
                certain threshold, the movie is recommended to the user. The higher the predicted rating, the higher the
                likelihood that the user will enjoy the movie.</p>

            <h2>Code Explanation</h2>
            <p>The code is structured to load the training and test datasets, build and train the model, evaluate its
                performance, and use it for making predictions. The Matrix Factorization algorithm is particularly
                well-suited for recommendation systems, as it can handle sparse data effectively.</p>
